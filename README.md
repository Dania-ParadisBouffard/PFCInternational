# PFCInternational

PFCInternational is an attempt at illustrating the international cooperation (IC) landscape at the University of Sherbrooke (UdeS). The goal is to give people, from and outside the university, an overview of the projects, the norms, the practices, the ressources and the structure of IC actors emanating from the UdeS.
